Each row concerns hospital records of patients diagnosed with diabetes, who underwent laboratory, medications, and stayed up to 14 days. The goal is to determine the early readmission of the patient within 30 days of discharge.\\nThe problem is important for the following reasons. Despite high-quality evidence showing improved clinical outcomes for diabetic patients who receive various preventive and therapeutic interventions, many patients do not receive them. This can be partially attributed to arbitrary diabetes management in hospital environments, which fail to attend to glycemic control. Failure to provide proper diabetes care not only increases the managing costs for the hospitals (as the patients are readmitted) but also impacts the morbidity and mortality of the patients, who may face complications associated with diabetes.\\n', 'area': 'Health and Medicine', 'tasks': ['Classification', 'Clustering'], 'characteristics': ['Multivariate'], 'num_instances': 101766, 'num_features': 47, 'feature_types': ['Categorical', 'Integer'], 'demographics': ['Race', 'Gender', 'Age'], 'target_col': ['readmitted'], 'index_col': ['encounter_id', 'patient_nbr'], 'has_missing_values': 'yes', 'missing_values_symbol': 'NaN', 'year_of_dataset_creation': 2014, 'last_updated': 'Mon Feb 26 2024', 'dataset_doi': '10.24432/C5230J', 'creators': ['John Clore', 'Krzysztof Cios', 'Jon DeShazo', 'Beata Strack'], 'intro_paper': {'title': 'Impact of HbA1c Measurement on Hospital Readmission Rates: Analysis of 70,000 Clinical Database Patient Record', 'authors': 'Beata Strack, Jonathan DeShazo, Chris Gennings, Juan Olmo, Sebastian Ventura, Krzysztof Cios, John Clore', 'published_in': 'BioMed Research International, vol. 2014', 'year': 2014, 'url': 'https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/781670/', 'doi': None}, 'additional_info': {'summary': 'The dataset represents ten years (1999-2008) of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks.
