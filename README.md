# Other than the imports into your cs178 conda profile listed in the first discussion slides "cs178_s24_D00.ipynb", also import the ucimlrepo by activating the cs178 conda profile and then running 'conda install ucimlrepo'. If 'conda install ucimlrepo' doesn't work, run 'pip install ucimlrepo' instead.

# Run 'jupyter lab' in this repo's directory, and then make whatever changes you need to the notebook to test different ML models.
